# Notes 

### What is Duality good for? 
1. Dual variables give insight into the data
2. Duality let us prove theorems about the generalization error of the classifier 
3. If dimensionality d of x is large, working in the dual representation can be computationally more efficient if x_i dot x_j is more efficient
